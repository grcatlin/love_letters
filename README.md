# Love Letters

This project demonstrates the use of spatial clustering on census blocks in the Casper, WY area. 
The fictitious application is determining the number and placement of vans that deliver "handwritten" greeting cards within Casper.
The concept is based off of Theodore's job in the movie "Her".
